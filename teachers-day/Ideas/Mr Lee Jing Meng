Dear Mr Lee,
  I have always found your experiments fun and interesting.
  Be it separating a mixture through chromatography
  Or putting a raw quill egg in water,
  All of which, fascinating
  It was always fun and I would like to plead
  Bring we more to the lab. indeed
  
  You have given us so much notes
  About SE, PCM, ECM, SS and ST
  Not forgetting PNM, AS, CE, MS and LT
  On behalf of everyone
  I sincerly wanted to ask
  Can we please have more science class?
